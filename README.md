## üîß Setup

### 1. (Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment
- `python -m venv venv`
- Linux / macOS: `source venv/bin/activate`

### 2. Install dependencies
- Inside the virtual environment: `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
- Or globally: `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` (especially on Windows if `pip install` fails)

### 3. Create a `.env` file with the following format:
```
CLIENT_ID = 'xxxxxxxxx'
CLIENT_SECRET = 'xxxxxxxxx'
REDIRECT_URI = 'http://localhost:8888/callback'
```
### 4. Get your ID and SECRET from [Spotify's Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
- (you need to create an app) and replace the xxxxxxxxx values with your credentials.
### 5. Start the app
- Change `app.run()` to `app.run(port=8888)` in main.
- Run `main.py`
- The website will be available at http://localhost:8888
